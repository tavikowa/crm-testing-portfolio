# QA Portfolio - CRM & Workflow Testing

## 🚀 About the Project
This repository serves as a practical portfolio demonstrating my Software Testing skills, tailored for business systems (CRM/Workflow).
The project focuses on verifying a **SuiteCRM** system, covering functional testing, database verification, and API testing.

**Goal:** To simulate real-world QA tasks required for complex business applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **System Under Test:** SuiteCRM (Open Source Demo)
* **Test Management:** Excel, Jira-style bug reporting in .md files
* **Database:** SQL (Data verification queries)
* **API Testing:** Postman (REST API)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📂 Repository Structure
| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01_Functional_Testing_CRM` | Test Plans, Test Scenarios (Excel), and Workflow analysis. |
| `02_Bug_Reports` | Detailed bug reports with steps to reproduce and severity assessment. |
| `03_SQL_Verification` | SQL queries designed to verify backend data integrity.* |
| `04_API_Tests` | Postman collection for backend testing (REST API).** |

*Queries are written purely for demonstration due to unavailable database access; they do not mirror the live **SuiteCRM** database structure.

**Due to authentication restrictions on the public SuiteCRM demo, API connectivity and assertion logic were demonstrated using the reliable *JSONPlaceholder* and *ReqRes* public APIs.
